#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

--#1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

--#2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "netflix_titles_info";

--#3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;

--#4. Who was the Director the for move The Starling?
SELECT director
FROM "netflix_titles_info" titles
LEFT JOIN "netflix_people" people
ON titles.show_id=people.show_id
WHERE title='The Starling';

--#5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year asc
LIMIT 1;

--#6 Use a subquery to see all the oldest movies without assuming that there was only 1 that year.
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type = 'Movie'
AND release_year <=
(SELECT MIN(release_year)

WHERE type = 'Movie');
