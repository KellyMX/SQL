In this Project I work with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
#  This database diagram:
#employees table stores employees data such as employee id, last name, first name, etc. It also has a field named ReportsTo to specify who reports to whom.
#customers table stores customers data. The line between employees.Employeeid and customers.SupportRepID shows how the two tables are related (ie, how you would JOIN them).
#The invoices table stores invoice header data (Customer ID, Billing Address, etc) and the invoice_items table stores the invoice line items data (Unit Price, Quantity).
#artists table stores artists data.
#albums table stores data about a list of tracks. Each album belongs to one artist. However, one artist may have multiple albums.
#media_types table stores media types such as MPEG audio and AAC audio files.
#genres table stores music types such as rock, jazz, metal, etc.
#tracks table stores the data of songs. Each track belongs to one album.
#playlists table store data about playlists. Each playlist contains a list of tracks. Each track may belong to multiple playlists. The relationship between the playlists table and tracks table is many-to-many. The playlist_track table is used to reflect this relationship.

#I use this to answer the following questions, starting with simple queries to get familiar with the data, then getting to more specific questions that could be of great use:



#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country 
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country != "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Germany.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers 
WHERE Country = "Germany";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Germany. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices as inv
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers as cust
ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
WHERE Country = "Germany"

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.Employees
WHERE Title= "Sales Support Agent"

#5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT distinct BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER By BillingCountry asc

#6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees emp ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId


#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, 
emp.FirstName as "Sales Agent First Name", emp.LastName as "Sales Agent Last Name", inv.Total
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.employees emp ON emp.EmployeeId=cust.SupportRepId

#8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like "2009%"

OR

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9.What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate like "2009%"


#10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, invi.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items invi ON invi.TrackId=t.TrackId


#11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.Name, a.Name, invi.InvoiceLineId 
FROM chinook.invoice_items invi
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t ON invi.TrackID=t.TrackID
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums alb ON t.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists a ON alb.ArtistId=a.ArtistId
ORDER BY invi.InvoiceLineId asc


#12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name as "Track Name", alb.Title as "Album Name", 
mt.Name as "Media Type", g.Name as "Genre"
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.albums alb ON t.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types mt ON t.MediaTypeId=mt.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g ON t.GenreId=g.GenreId


#13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, 
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = "Sales Support Agent"
GROUP BY emp.EmployeeId;

#14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, 
ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.employees emp
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON emp.EmployeeId = cust.SupportRepId
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = "Sales Support Agent"
AND inv.InvoiceDate like "2009%"
GROUP BY emp.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) desc
LIMIT 1

#15. Which 3 customers spent the most based on their total spending?
SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS TotalSpent
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON cust.CustomerId = inv.CustomerId
GROUP BY cust.CustomerId
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
LIMIT 3;


#16. Which year had the highest total sales?
SELECT strftime('%Y', inv.InvoiceDate) AS Year, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS TotalSales
FROM chinook.invoices inv
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY TotalSales DESC
Limit 1

#17. Find the top 3 countries with the highest total spending.
SELECT inv.BillingCountry, ROUND(SUM(inv.Total),2) AS TotalSpent
FROM chinook.invoices inv
GROUP BY inv.BillingCountry
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC
LIMIT 3;
